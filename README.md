An implementation of the classic sliding puzzle game using PyGame.

The project was designed with one goal in mind: to be as intuitive and as satisfying to play as possible.
The former is achieved by building redundancy into the controls; for example, the tiles can be moved around using both the mouse and the arrow keys.
The latter is achieved by making the animations smooth, designing clean visuals, and selecting euphonic sound effects.

## Installation

Python 3.10

### Required External Libraries

- pygame 2.3.0


## How to Play

The objective is to move the tiles one at a time so that they are arranged in ascending order from top-left to bottom-right. All the controls and configurable settings are listed in the menu which can be accessed by pressing esc or by clicking the menu icon in the top right of the window.


## 3 by 3 Too Easy?

The puzzle size can be as big as you want (or as big as your computer can handle!). Just click the cog icon in the menu and change "Puzzle Size". Additionally, increase the difficulty by increasing "Scramble Number" - the number of tiles shifted from the solved configuration.
